# Primary User
This interactive tool was created as an alternative to 311. Residents and community members can anonymously report building conditions that are routed to a coalition of local community organizations, legal advocacy groups, and policymakers (instead of the Department of Licenses and Inspections). The interface in this repository is the coalition-facing “dispatch console” used after reports are received.

The primary user is a coalition dispatcher or case coordinator who has limited time, is juggling multiple open reports, and needs a shared workflow for triage, collaboration, and follow-through. The toool will also be used by coalition members to interact with cases.

## Needs
The current reporting system for code violations responds to substandard property conditions through escalating enforcement and accumulating fees that can result in financial and emotional distress. Rerouting reports to a coalition operating under a care-based model centers community support over punishment-motivated action.

From a dispatch perspective, the user needs:
- A fast way to find and triage urgent cases without losing context.
- A consistent “case workspace” that keeps key details, status, and notes in one place.
- Lightweight collaboration tools (comments + internal notes) that do not require external systems.
- Simple handoffs between partner organizations (referrals) when one org cannot take on a case.

## Motivations
The coalition is often only put in touch with residents when situations have reached a critical need for intervention and housing or health is already in a perilous state. If residents can self-report earlier, they can get connected to services and resources before conditions deteriorate beyond repair.

The dispatcher is motivated by:
- Reducing harm: prioritize support, safety, and stabilization rather than punitive enforcement.
- Speed and clarity: quickly understand what is happening, who owns the case, and what the next step is.
- Shared accountability: keep a transparent record of actions, referrals, and updates across organizations.
- Preventing drop-offs: ensure cases do not stall due to unclear ownership or missing follow-up.

## Success Criteria
- A dispatcher can identify priority cases in seconds and open a case workspace with the correct context.
- Coalition partners can add comments/notes and see them reflected immediately.
- Referrals are easy to initiate and leave an auditable trail of what was sent and when.
