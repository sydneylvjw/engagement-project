# FLICR Coalition Console

This interactive tool was designed as an alternative to 311 for homeowners, residents, and community members to make anonymous reports on neighborhood conditions without fear of punitive retaliation. What is presented is a dispatch app called the First Line in Community Reporting (FLICR) network. The end user is a dispatch worker for a local coalition consisting of advocacy groups and social service organizations from across Philadelphia. After taking calls, the dispatch worker and other Coalition members can review and assume responsibility for cases, track follow-up activity, and collaborate through comments, notes, and assignment workflows.

## Overview
- **Search + filters** – Filter reports by keyword (title/address/neighborhood) plus priority, status, and responsibility.
- **Live feed & follow-up** – Live feed consists of chronological recent cases. The report activity node is cases that have had recent interaction.
- **Case workspace** – Review case details, collaborate through comments/notes, and move a case forward using the action center (refer, assign, tag, close, request collaboration).

## Data
The data in mockReports.json was generated using an LLM to simulate the use case. `npm run generate:data` regenerates a new dataset.
